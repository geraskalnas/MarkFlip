An h1 header<br />Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.<br />2nd paragraph. <em>Italic</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, and <code>monospace</code>. Itemized listslook like:<br />  <em> this one  * that one  </em> the other one<br />Note that  not considering the asterisk  the actual textcontent starts at 4columns in.<br />> Block quotes are> written like so.>> They can span multiple paragraphs,> if you like.<br />Use 3 dashes for an emdash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's allin chapters 1214"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.Unicode is supported. â˜º<br /><br />An h2 header<br />Here's a numbered list:<br /> 1. first item 2. second item 3. third item<br />Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 charactersfrom the left side). Here's a code sample:<br />    <h1>Let me reiterate ...</h1>    for i in 1 .. 10 { dosomething(i) }<br />As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead ofindenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:<br />~~~define foobar() {    print "Welcome to flavor country!";}~~~<br />(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark thedelimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:<br />~~~pythonimport time<h1>Quick, count to ten!</h1>for i in range(10):    <h1>(but not <em>too</em> quick)</h1>    time.sleep(0.5)    print i~~~<br /><br /><h3>An h3 header ###</h3><br />Now a nested list:<br /> 1. First, get these ingredients:<br />      <em> carrots      * celery      </em> lentils<br /> 2. Boil some water.<br /> 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow    this algorithm:<br />        find wooden spoon        uncover pot        stir        cover pot        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle        wait 10 minutes        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)<br />    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.<br />Notice again how text always lines up on 4space indents (includingthat last line which continues item 3 above).<br />Here's a link to <a href'http://foo.bar'>a website</a>, to a <a href'localdoc.html'>localdoc</a>, and to a <a href'<h1>anh2header'>section heading in the currentdoc</a>. Here's a footnote [^1].</h1><br />[^1]: Footnote text goes here.<br />Tables can look like this:<br />size  material      color    9     leather       brown10    hemp canvas   natural11    glass         transparent<br />Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of<br />(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supportsmultiline tables:<br />  keyword   text  red       Sunsets, apples, and          other red or reddish          things.<br />green     Leaves, grass, frogs          and other things it's          not easy being.  <br />A horizontal rule follows.<br />***<br />Here's a definition list:<br />apples  : Good for making applesauce.oranges  : Citrus!tomatoes  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.<br />Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between eachterm/definition pair to spread things out more.)<br />Here's a "line block":<br />| Line one|   Line too| Line tree<br />and images can be specified like so:<br /><img src'exampleimage.jpg' alt'An exemplary image'><br />Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega  d\phi / dt$. Displaymath should get its own line and be put in in doubledollarsigns:<br />$$I  \int \rho R^{2} dV$$<br />And note that you can backslashescape any punctuation characterswhich you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: `foo`, *bar*, etc.</body>
